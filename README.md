# INVENTORY APPLICATION

This project is part of <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application'>TheOdinProject</a>.

In this project I need to create an inventory management app for an imaginary store. The inventory app should have categories and items, so when the user goes to the home-page they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. For this project I include all of the CRUD methods for both items and categories, so anybody thatâ€™s visiting the site can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.
